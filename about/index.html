&emsp;&emsp;Throughout my life, I have always loved to solve puzzles, think, and create. I'm always thinking, learning, and adapting to my situation. Thus, its only natural that thought, philosophy, and learning in general are a big part of my psyche! This interest has manifested itself in many ways, but this desire to learn, expand, and solve puzzles has primarily been a driving factor in my interest in code, computers, and engineering as a whole.<br> &emsp;&emsp;My interest in leadership are another thing entirely. Throughout my childhood, one tennant I tried and still try to stick by is Servant Leadership - the philosophy that a leader should only lead to serve others, and that being humble is the biggest prize of all. After all, the best king doesnt need clothes, riches, or men to be considered great. In this beleif though, I found a passion. I, as a person, love to help people and be there, and in leadership, I find I can do so.  Leadership is what keeps everyone together, and by being the person to do so, I find great satisfaction and happiness. Thus, leadership is a final important tennant to me.<br>&emsp;&emsp; All of these together are what make me me, and throughout the past semester, my research into my personality has provided a lot of really interesting clarification on things I sometimes never even thought about, but say a lot about me. Everything fits together, somehow, and its really interesting to see just <I>how</i>.

&emsp;&emsp; While researching the holland codes, I learned a lot about myself as a person. First, I want to focus on my highest results: Realistic, Investigative, and Artistic. This makes a lot of sense. I mentioned earlier my investigativeness, as a facet of my interest in learning and expanding. Im always trying to ask <i>why</i>, and get to the deeper awnser and understanding. Realistic makes a lot of sense too. The description of just being practical, logical, and hands-on fits me well. I am always tinkering, and creating, and I work through situations and problems with a cynical attitude and logic. Artistic is another way to describe me, as despite my interests and lines of work, I create music, art, and sing as well. All of this makes a lot of sense to me. It shows a lot about how I've grown as a human and in life overall. Very interesting.

&emsp;&emsp; ENFP (Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perciving)<br>
<i>Extraversion:</i><br>&emsp;"An orientation of oneâ€™s interests and energies toward the outer world of people and things rather than the inner world of subjective experience."<br>
<i>Intuition:</i><br>&emsp;"Paying the most attention to impressions or the meaning and patterns of the information analyzed."<br>
<i>Feeling:</i><br>&emsp;"Trying to do whatever will establish or maintain harmony in the world."<br>
<i>Perciving:</i><br>&emsp;"Preference for a flexible and adaptible lifestyle; always on the move"<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;My results in this test to say the least, suprised me. I had taken one of these tests before, and previously, I was an INTP (Introverted, Intuition, Thinking, Perciving) or a Logician. One of the things this shows is how as a human I have changed over time. Where I formally was introverted and craved time alone as a method of recharging, I now find myself happier with others and recharging in the presence of friends. Where I formerly was reclusive, in my mind, and thinking, now I crave feeling and happiness with others. My development over the years is very interesting to say the least and its captivated my attention. I am very interested to see how things change in the future! My personality is defined as an Adventurer. This blends interestingly with my previous results in the Holland Summary code, as well as others. One would think a pragmatic thinker, with a touch for art might be an introverted recluse, but I think this contrast highlights something special: people are not always linear. A personality isnt static, nor absolute in the slightest and people can be subject to their own interests despite the common path of most others of their personality. There is probably also something to be said for me developing these interests as an INTP, but now they are maintained. Overall, finding out this new end result was a very interesting thing to research, and ponder overall. By doing this self retrospection, I have learned a lot about myself as a human. I am excited to see what my future personality holds for me and looking forward to live through it!

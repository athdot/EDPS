Marketing your major pamphlet: <br>

<img src="https://athdot.github.io/EDPS/images/pamphlet.png" align="left" style="width: 20%" />

&emsp;&emsp;In my research into Mechanical Engineering, I gained many perspectives on options. The classes and major options I looked into were very inspiring – and by doing so, I found things that reinforced my passion. My understanding on the subject also allowed me to grow in terms of wants as well. Whereas at the beginning of the school year all I wanted was to be in engineering, through my research and personal development, I decided to try to specialize in Computer Science. This research is testament to that. To conclude, this informed me of many options and paths that I have the ability to take in the future but also opened my eyes to the cross compatibility of it all – from my research, I no longer feel constrained to one path – I can take whatever is comfortable and live a life to dream of. From this, I gathered interest and decided to fully invest myself in my path towards my dreams.

Roadtrip Nation Research: <br>

<img src="https://athdot.github.io/EDPS/images/roadtrip.png" align="right" style="margin: 20 20 20 20; width: 20%;" />

&emsp;&emsp;Roadtrip nation as a tool was incredibly helpful. My research into Computers and Information systems was not only informative, but it helped me understand just what I really want in terms of a career. Not only does a career focusing on Leadership, Problem Solving, and Research captivate me, but it motivates me to want more. Throughout the past semester I have not only learned a lot about myself but a lot about what I look for in a future. Through this, by asking questions and learning, I was able to make a concise decision about deciding to pursue a passion in this fashion.

Music:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Music has always been a major part of my life, ever since I set my hands on a piano when I was young. Throughout my life I have always been creating, thinking, and expressing myself through the wonderful medium that is music. As I got older, I began to compose. Music in general has always had somewhat of a trancendental meaning for me, and in a way I've grown as a human being as a result. It wasnt until high school that I actually began to produce my own music and write.

The following information could be considered sensitive content, and should not be viewed if depitions of gruesome and trauma-inducing experiences to do with weapons and death cause trouble. This subject is a sensitive subject, however, it is being included due to its overall impact in my life as well as the lives of countless others. Consider yourself warned.<br>--- /!\ ---</p>

<br>&emsp;&emsp;One music writing experience of mine has a major meaning in my life as a whole. It began in the wake of the 2019 STEM School Highlands Ranch Shooting, where many friends, acquaintances, and peers were dealing with the post traumatic maelstrom surrounding our school. I had known Kendrick Castillo, and the events of that day, the sounds of the gunshots, and the spots of blood on the floor. I was there when it happened and I had friends that were in the room that it happened. In the wake of this event, many from my school were struck with not only severe anxiety, but as we all contintued to go to school every day after it had happened, we went through the pain of coming back to the spot where it had all happened for the rest of the year.<img src="https://athdot.github.io/EDPS/images/stem.jpg" align="right" style="margin: 20 20 20 20; width: 30%;" /> One thing I struggled with in this period was maintaining motivation and finishing out the school year high. After it had happened I was unable to put pen to paper, and felt numb day after day, in a state of unfeeling grief. It all didn't matter anymore, not school and not anything. It took nearly until the end of the year to reinvigorate myself and even then, school was chaos. Three days before the end of the school year, my music teacher the past year, Brent Roach, had reached out to me asking for my assistance. He wanted to create a song, not only in honor of Kendrick, but in honor of all the students, teachers, and people who had gone through this with us all. I accepted. The challenge of this was that we wanted to have every student in the schools voice to sing in the song. I had three days. To gather a crew to record everyone, chart out what teachers we would go to, to finish the song and get it to everyone involved. I worked from 7 am to 9 pm for the next 2 days, planning everything and orchestrating everything. Just before the end of school, everyone was recorded and put into the music, as a last unifying force. This song is attached below. If you listen through it, it begins with the music teacher, Brent Roach, singing "The most beautiful roads lead to the most beautiful places" - which was Kendricks senior quote - before expanding on the theme. In the middle of the song, everyone joins in, in chorus. "You've got to live". Other renditions have been preformed, but this was the original and it was how at the end of the year, the students at STEM showed their Unity. This project was not only an artistic challenge, but a logistical one as well and in the end, we came through. Heres to us!

&emsp;&emsp;Besides Difficult Roads, I have worked on many other musical projects, dabbling in genres such as Improvisational Jazz, Romantic era waltz, 70s synth pop, Indie, and many more, along with my band Chinasaur and the Consultants, as well as by myself. Music is a major part of my life and its one thing I will always love.

Computer Science, Coding, and More!

&emsp;&emsp;Computer Science has long been a part of my life, and I even have my first code experience all the way back in 7th grade. I began with JavaScript, but throughout the years I have expanded, learned, and broadened my repitoir to contain things like C, C#, Java, JavaScript, A little Python, RobotC, and of course, HTML (Speaking of HTML, did you know that I hard coded this entire website? Crazy, right?). In fact, you can even look up old code of mine on JSFiddle, the picture to the side. My experience in code heavily mirrors my development as an individual, as it has been with me in all the time I belive I have come to become who I am today.
<br><Br>&emsp;&emsp;In my career as a developer, I have been in many projects, including some releasable video games, and more. Of the things I've coded, my experiments into Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms are both things that I am very proud of. Down below is one game I developed with a team of 2 other developers, and 3 artists which I spearheaded, called Grapple. The premise of the game was that you were an astronaut, stuck in space and all you had to get around was a grapple gun. By shooting asteroids, you would pull yourself around a scene, dodging enemies, as well as dealing with the physics of pulling an asteroid towards you that had the potential to do some serious damage. On a side note, I also created the music for the game!

&emsp;&emsp;Overall, outside of school, I love to keep myself occupied! Among some of my current projects, are an orthographic campy RPG style, plot driven game, which has allready seen some substantial development. Things currently being worked on in that project is plot development, art, and music! While its development is not top piority, in a few months it is planned to release on steam!
<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I have also been working on a bot to track and manage stock portfolios - codenamed Valkyrie, meant to act as a psuedo-organization, managing positions such as stocks to watch, micromanaging investments, and overall predicting trends based on world situation as well as previously encoded thresholds for how an overall stock is <i>doing</i>.
<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Beyond this, I have another album in the works - intended to be my debut on Spotify, as well as many other things!
